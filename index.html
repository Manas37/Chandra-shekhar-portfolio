            <p>
                Hello, I'm Chandra Shekhar, currently in my pre-final year of university, making strides and carving a niche in the fascinating world of technology. Over the course of my journey, my command over Data Structure and Algorithms, Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, and Git has set me apart in this fast-paced industry.
<br>
                I've had the opportunity to apply my skills as a Java Backend Developer Intern, where I not only grew my technical capabilities but also honed my collaborative and leadership skills. This internship enabled me to understand the practical implications of my foundational knowledge, and I eagerly passed on this wisdom to my teammates, recognizing that success is built on shared learnings.
                <br>
                Additionally, I've had the privilege of interning at Geeks for Geeks, a respected platform within the technology community. Here, I further expanded my horizons in problem-solving, algorithm development, and in helping others on their programming journey.
                <br>
                But, I believe that knowledge grows when it's shared, a principle that led me to author several articles on Spring Boot. Writing these was more than just an experience - it was a chance to connect with developers around the world, and provide useful insights that would help them in their individual paths.
                <br>
                In essence, I'm not just a student, an intern, or a developer. I'm a progressive force in the tech industry, driving forward both myself and the community at large.
